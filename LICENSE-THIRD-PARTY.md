# Third-party licences

Tengoku is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)), **except** for the
third-party material listed below, which stays under its upstream licence. Nothing here relicenses anyone's work.

## 1. Seeded packages (`Tengoku/`)

The tree was seeded by folding the source files of these packages into topic paths (`scripts/seed.py`).
Seeded files are copied as they are upstream, copyright headers included wherever the upstream file has one;
the aggregator modules (`Tengoku/Std.lean` and the like) are generated.

| Package | Upstream | Licence | Folded into |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mathlib | [leanprover-community/mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/` (topic paths) |
| Batteries | [leanprover-community/batteries](https://github.com/leanprover-community/batteries) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Std/` |
| Aesop | [leanprover-community/aesop](https://github.com/leanprover-community/aesop) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Tactic/Aesop/` |
| Qq | [leanprover-community/quote4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/quote4) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Meta/Qq/` |
| ProofWidgets | [leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Widgets/`, `widget/` |
| Plausible | [leanprover-community/plausible](https://github.com/leanprover-community/plausible) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Testing/Random/` |
| LeanSearchClient | [leanprover-community/LeanSearchClient](https://github.com/leanprover-community/LeanSearchClient) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Search/LeanSearchClient/` |
| import-graph | [leanprover-community/import-graph](https://github.com/leanprover-community/import-graph) | Apache-2.0 | `Tengoku/Meta/ImportGraph/` |
| lean4-cli | [leanprover/lean4-cli](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-cli) | MIT | `Tengoku/Meta/Cli/` |

lean4-cli is MIT-licensed: `Copyright (c) 2021 mhuisi` ([licence](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-cli/blob/main/LICENSE)). The MIT permission notice is reproduced in section 4.

## 2. Records from registered libraries (`data/`) and the modules generated from them

Each record in `data/tentative/`, `data/staging/` and `data/trusted/` names its origin in `source_url`, and each
library's licence is recorded in `schemas/sources.json` (`licences`). A record, and any module under
`Tengoku/<Library>/` generated from it, is distributed under the licence of the library it came from.

The records in `data/trusted/mathlib-*.jsonl` describe the seeded Mathlib and are Apache-2.0 like it.

The records from [competemath.com](https://competemath.com/practice/problems) are Apache-2.0: their author
released them under it, and the site's terms release problems and proofs under it when posted.

94 registered libraries are Apache-2.0, the same licence as this repository; their copyright
notices are those of the upstream repositories linked in `schemas/sources.json`.

Only permissively licensed libraries are registered. Copyleft material (GPL, AGPL, LGPL and the like)
cannot be compiled into one Apache-2.0 tree with everything else, so a source under such a licence is
not accepted.

## 3. Changes made to upstream material

As Apache-2.0 section 4(b) asks, the changes this repository makes to what it redistributes:

- **Seeded packages** (`scripts/seed.py`): files are moved to topic paths under `Tengoku/`; `import`
  lines, including module-system forms such as `public import`, are rewritten to the new module names;
  instance names Lean derives from the module root change their suffix from `_mathlib` to `_tengoku`;
  the root module `Tengoku.lean` gains a header comment and imports of the other seeded roots;
  ProofWidgets' demo modules are left out; `lakefile.toml` sets `maxSynthPendingDepth = 3`, as Mathlib's
  own lakefile does. Every seeded file that was changed says so in a line at its top, naming the package
  and commit it came from (`scripts/notices.py`); nothing else in a seeded file is edited.
- **Records** (`data/`): a statement and its proof are copied from the source file, with the context
  above it. Translated records are re-elaborated on this tree's toolchain, and an agent may rewrite
  the proof, or restate definitions without the source's notations, so that it compiles there.
- **Generated modules** (`Tengoku/<Library>/`, `scripts/generate.py`): records are wrapped in the
  library's namespace, their imports mapped onto the tree, corpus-only attributes stripped, and
  definitions shared by several records emitted once.

## 4. Removed sources

Earlier commits of this repository contained records from two copyleft libraries, removed because
their licences cannot be combined with the Apache-2.0 tree:

- `lean-wasm`: [T-Brick/lean-wasm](https://github.com/T-Brick/lean-wasm), GPL-3.0
- `software-foundations-lean`: [PnVDiscord/software-foundations-lean](https://github.com/PnVDiscord/software-foundations-lean), AGPL-3.0

Those copies remain in the git history under their upstream licences and are not covered by Apache-2.0.
