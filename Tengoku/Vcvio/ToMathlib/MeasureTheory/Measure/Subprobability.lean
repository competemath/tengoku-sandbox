# Subprobability measures

`IsSubprobabilityMeasure μ` states that `μ Set.univ ≤ 1`. It is the mass discipline of a
computation that may fail to return: the defect `1 - μ Set.univ` is the mass that never reached a
value, so a returned result and a failure stay distinguishable without an `Option` wrapper.

Mathlib has no such class. `IsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure` is a different condition — it admits only
total mass `0` or `1`, and so cannot describe a computation that fails with probability strictly
between the two.

The class is closed under the Giry operations that build denotations: `dirac`, `map` along a
measurable function, and `bind` against a subprobability family. The `bind` statement carries its
almost-everywhere measurability hypothesis explicitly rather than being an instance, matching the
Giry monad's own API.
