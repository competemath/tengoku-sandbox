# Discarding the `none` part of an option-valued measure

`Measure.dropNone` turns a measure on `Option α` into the submeasure of successful values on
`α`. It is the effect-preserving boundary needed by `OptionT` and by finite observations of a
possibly nonterminating computation: the `none` mass is discarded instead of being confused with
an ordinary result.

The definition uses the Giry bind. The coproduct measurable structure makes the success/failure
case split measurable without requiring `α` itself to be discrete.

/-! ## Completing a subprobability measure with an explicit failure outcome -/

/-- Turn a subprobability measure into a measure on `Option α` by mapping successful outcomes
through `some` and assigning all missing mass to `none`.

The definition is meaningful for every measure. The expected probability-measure law requires
the explicit subprobability hypothesis `μ univ ≤ 1`; keeping that hypothesis visible avoids a
blanket bundled subprobability type at the primary semantics boundary. -/
