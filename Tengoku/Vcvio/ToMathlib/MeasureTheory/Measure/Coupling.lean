# Couplings of measures

This file defines couplings directly at Mathlib's `Measure` boundary.  A coupling is a joint
measure whose first and second marginals are the requested measures.  No discreteness or
countability assumption is built into the definition.

The elementary constructors here are the measure-theoretic foundation for VCVio's relational
program logic. In particular, relational postconditions can be stated almost everywhere under
the joint measure instead of by quantifying over discrete point support.
