# Expected draws of a negative hypergeometric experiment

Sampling without replacement from a population of `M` items containing `G` successes, how many
draws are needed on average before `r` successes have been collected? Conditioning on the first
draw gives the recursion implemented by `expectedDraws`, and `expectedDraws_eq` evaluates it to
the closed form `r * (M + 1) / (G + 1)` whenever `r ≤ G ≤ M`.

The closed form is carried by `mul_expectedDraws`, which clears the denominator so that the
induction proving it never divides in `ℝ≥0∞`; `expectedDraws_eq` recovers the divided form.

When fewer than `r` successes are available the experiment cannot finish and instead exhausts the
population. The closed form does not apply there, but the same expression remains an *upper*
bound: `mul_expectedDraws_le` and `expectedDraws_le` drop the hypothesis `r ≤ G` entirely, and the
recursion step is still an equality — only the base cases lose mass. That single inequality is what
a rewinding argument needs, since it covers the finishing and the exhausting case at once.

Coordinate-wise rewinding arguments use this at `M = N - 1`, `G = l - 1` and `r = k - 1`: when a
challenge coordinate ranges over a set of size `N` of which `l` values are accepting, resampling
that coordinate without replacement collects `k - 1` further accepting values after at most
`(k - 1) * N / l` draws on average (`expectedDraws_resample_le`). The loop that exhausts a
coordinate holding fewer than `k` accepting values is included: with `l ≤ r` the bound
`r * N / l` already exceeds the population size `N - 1`.

/-- Expected number of draws needed to collect `r` successes when sampling without replacement
from a population of `M` items containing `G` successes.

The first draw succeeds with probability `G / M`, leaving `G - 1` successes among `M - 1` items,
and fails with probability `(M - G) / M`, leaving `G` successes among `M - 1` items. Truncated
subtraction is harmless here: `G - 1` is only reached with a nonzero coefficient when `G ≠ 0`,
and `M + 1 - G` with a nonzero coefficient only when `G ≤ M`. An exhausted population draws
nothing. -/
