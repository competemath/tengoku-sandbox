# Radon-Nikodym derivatives of `PMF.toMeasure`

Mathlib's divergences are stated through `Measure.rnDeriv`, while VCVio's are stated as sums of
pointwise masses. `PMF.rnDeriv_toMeasure` is the equation between the two: the derivative of one
`PMF`'s measure against another's is the pointwise ratio.

It is what lets a measure-level divergence result be read back as the `tsum` formula an existing
`PMF` proof is stated in, and conversely.

## Two useful forms

The unrestricted bridge is stated on a countable carrier with measurable singletons. This is the
legacy API and applies, for example, to ordinary Borel spaces when the carrier is countable.

For callers such as `SPMF` that work over an arbitrary carrier, the `_of_ac` form removes the
carrier-countability assumption by restricting the integral to the countable support of `q`. It
uses `q.toMeasure` itself as the dominating measure and therefore carries an explicit absolute-
continuity hypothesis.

## The absolute-continuity hypothesis

The unrestricted theorem is an almost-everywhere equality and does not need absolute continuity:
points where `q` vanishes are already invisible to `=ᵐ[q.toMeasure]`. The arbitrary-carrier
`rnDeriv_toMeasure_of_ac` uses absolute continuity only because its supporting `withDensity`
factorization does.
