# Total variation against the Hellinger affinity

For two densities against a common measure, this is the inequality `TV² ≤ 1 - BC²`, where `BC` is
the Hellinger affinity (the Bhattacharyya coefficient in the discrete case). It is one of the two
halves of the Renyi-to-total-variation bound; the other is log-convexity of the Renyi moment
generating function, in `ToMathlib.Probability.Divergence.Renyi`.

## The argument

Writing `m = ∫ min f g` and `M = ∫ max f g`, the two pointwise identities `min + max = f + g` and
`|f - g| + 2·min f g = f + g` give `m + M = 2` and `TV + m = 1`, hence `M = 1 + TV`. Since
`min · max = f · g`, Cauchy-Schwarz — Hölder at exponents `1/2` and `1/2`, so the *same*
`ENNReal.lintegral_mul_norm_pow_le` that powers the log-convexity step — bounds
`BC ≤ m^{1/2} M^{1/2}`, whence `BC² ≤ m·M` and `BC² + TV² ≤ 1`.

Stating it for a pair of densities rather than a pair of measures keeps it free of
Radon-Nikodym bookkeeping, and lets the discrete corollary instantiate at a counting measure while
a measure-level one instantiates at `Measure.rnDeriv` against a common dominating measure.

The whole argument is additive: `BC² + TV² ≤ 1` is established first, and truncated subtraction
appears only in the final restatement.
