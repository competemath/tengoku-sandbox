# Uniform measures on finite spaces

This file supplies measure-level facts for finite uniform sampling. It identifies the mass of a
point under the uniform measure on the whole space, characterizes independent uniform draws as
the uniform measure on a product, and shows that a measurable bijection preserves uniformity.

The measurable-space assumptions stay explicit: the results require measurable singletons but do
not install a discrete measurable-space instance.
