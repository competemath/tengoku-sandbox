# Hölder Inequality for ENNReal-Valued Infinite Sums

This file provides a `tsum` version of Hölder's inequality for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued functions,
obtained by specializing the `lintegral` Hölder inequality to the counting measure.

The main advantage over `NNReal.inner_le_Lp_mul_Lq_tsum` in Mathlib is that no
`Summable` hypotheses are needed: `ℝ≥0∞` sums always converge (to `⊤` in the worst case).

## Main Results

- `ENNReal.inner_le_Lp_mul_Lq_tsum`: Hölder's inequality for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued `tsum`.

/-- Hölder's inequality for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued infinite sums:
`∑' i, f i * g i ≤ (∑' i, f i ^ p) ^ (1/p) * (∑' i, g i ^ q) ^ (1/q)`.

Obtained by specializing `ENNReal.lintegral_mul_le_Lp_mul_Lq` to the counting measure
with `DiscreteMeasurableSpace`. No `Summable` hypotheses are needed. Mathlib's lemma of the same
name lives in the `NNReal` namespace (`Mathlib/Analysis/MeanInequalities`) and carries `Summable`
hypotheses; this is the `ENNReal.` one. -/
