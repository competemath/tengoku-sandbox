# `limUnder` of an eventually-constant filter

A single utility lemma used by the residue-theory chain: if `f` is eventually
equal to a constant `c` along a non-trivial filter, then `limUnder l f = c`.

The bulk of this file used to host the winding-number integrality chain
(`exp_integral_eq_endpoint_ratio*`, the `gFunc_constant_*` G-function technique,
the `exists_*_avoiding_finset` shape lemmas, and the
`logDeriv_continuous*`/`stronglyMeasurable*`/`integral_hasDerivAt_*` infrastructure).
None of that material is reachable from the protected theorems
`LeanModularForms.hw_3_3_clean_full_mero` or `valence_formula_textbook`, so it has
been removed.
