# Piecewise C¹ Paths

This file defines piecewise C¹ paths in normed spaces, wrapping mathlib's `Path x y`
(parametrized on `[0,1]`) with piecewise C¹ smoothness conditions.

## Main definitions

* `PiecewiseC1Path x y` — a free-interval `PiecewiseC1PathOn 0 1 zero_lt_one x y`
  bundled with a mathlib `Path x y` whose `extend` agrees pointwise with `toFun` on
  `[0, 1]`. Differentiability and derivative continuity are inherited from the
  parent structure.

* `PwC1Immersion x y` — a `PiecewiseC1Path x y` whose derivative is nonzero away
  from partition points, with nonzero one-sided derivative limits at partition points.

## Design notes

`PiecewiseC1Path` extends `PiecewiseC1PathOn 0 1 zero_lt_one x y` (the free-interval
form). The bundled `Path x y` is kept as an explicit field because the `Path` API is
heavily used by call sites — in particular, the coercion `γ t = γ.toPath.extend t`
must remain stable. The witness `toPath_extend_eq_toFun` ties the two forms together
on `Icc 0 1`.

The definitions are stated for a `NormedAddCommGroup E` with `NormedSpace ℝ E`, which
covers `ℂ` as the main application.

/-- A piecewise continuously differentiable path from `x` to `y` in a normed space.

This bundles a free-interval `PiecewiseC1PathOn 0 1 zero_lt_one x y` together with a
mathlib `Path x y` whose `extend` agrees with the underlying function on `[0, 1]`.
Differentiability and continuous-derivative conditions are inherited from the parent. -/

This extends `PiecewiseC1Path x y` with the condition that the derivative is nonzero away from
partition points, and has nonzero one-sided limits at partition points. This ensures the path
has a well-defined tangent direction everywhere. -/
