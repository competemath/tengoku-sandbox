# Telescoping FTC for Log-Derivative on Piecewise Segments

When FTC-for-log is applied to consecutive segments sharing endpoints,
the log terms telescope. For a closed curve split at a crossing t₀ ± δ,
the total integral reduces to log(g(t₀-δ)) - log(g(t₀+δ)).

## Main results

* `ftc_telescope_two` — FTC on two consecutive segments telescopes
* `ftc_telescope_closed_split` — for closed curves, the full integral telescopes
  to the log difference at the crossing boundary
