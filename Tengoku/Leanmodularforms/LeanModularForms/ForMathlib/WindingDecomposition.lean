# Winding Number Decomposition — Proposition 2.3

Geometric crossing angle for the Hungerbühler–Wasem decomposition of the generalized
winding number.

## Main definitions

* `angleAtCrossing` — the signed angle at a crossing point where `γ` passes through
  `z₀`: `π` at a smooth point, `arg(L_right) - arg(-L_left)` at a partition (corner) point.

## Main results

* `angleAtCrossing_smooth` — at a smooth crossing point, the angle is `π`.

## References

* K. Hungerbühler, J. Wasem, *A generalized notion of winding numbers*

/-- The signed angle at a crossing point where a piecewise C¹ immersion passes through `z₀`.

At a smooth point (not in the partition), the tangent direction is continuous across the
crossing, and the angle between outgoing and negated incoming directions is `π`.

At a corner point (in the partition), the angle is `arg(L_right) - arg(-L_left)` where
`L_left` and `L_right` are the one-sided derivative limits. -/
