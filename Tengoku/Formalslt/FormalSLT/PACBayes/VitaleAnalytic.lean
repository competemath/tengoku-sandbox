# Analytic Vitale/Gaussian KL surface

This module widens the q056 continuous-prior certificate by adding the analytic
Gaussian-Gaussian closed-form KL calculation used by the worked continuous
PAC-Bayes examples.

The general non-Gaussian continuous KL theorem is deliberately not claimed
here: constructing Radon-Nikodym derivatives and KL integrals for arbitrary
continuous prior/posterior pairs needs a larger measure-theory development.
Instead, the general interface keeps the analytic upper-bound hypothesis
visible. The q062 spherical Gaussian bridge uses concrete finite-dimensional
Gaussian measures from `GaussianKL`; the older scalar equal-variance helper is
retained for compatibility with q060-era examples.

  error formula of Laplace" has no DOI/arXiv in the checked citation and was
  reported by `scripts/citation_audit.py` as `WARN_UNVERIFIABLE`.

  same audit through Crossref. The q060 prompt named "Vitale (1990)", but this
  checked reference is the Gaussian-process/Wills-functional source that
  resolves under the cited DOI; no 1990 identifier is fabricated here.

/-- Closed-form KL expression for one-dimensional Gaussian posteriors and priors.

The parameters are posterior mean/variance followed by prior mean/variance.
This is the usual scalar formula
`1/2 * (σq²/σp² + (μp-μq)^2/σp² - 1 + log(σp²/σq²))`, represented as a real
arithmetic expression rather than as a constructed Gaussian-measure KL. -/

/-- Analytic Vitale/KL control in the equal-variance Gaussian worked case.

Compared with `vitaleContinuousKL_certificate`, this theorem does not take the
final `kl ≤ vitaleTotalBound` inequality directly. It derives that inequality
from the Gaussian closed-form KL identity plus a verified real upper bound on
that closed form. -/
