Borel-Cantelli lemma, limsup-measure-zero form.

This is a claim-facing thin wrapper around mathlib's
`MeasureTheory.measure_limsup_atTop_eq_zero`. The statement matches the
TheoremPath claim's "$A_n$ infinitely often has probability zero" formulation
by representing "infinitely often" as `Filter.limsup A Filter.atTop`.

Borel-Cantelli lemma, eventually-not-in form.

This companion wrapper captures the prose consequence: almost every outcome
belongs to finitely many of the events.

/--
Second Borel-Cantelli lemma, independent-events limsup-measure-one form.

Scope note: mathlib states this wrapper with `iIndepSet`, which is stronger
than the governed claim's pairwise-independence wording. The manifest marks
this as scoped support until the pairwise version is formalized.
