Basic identities for probability measures.

This claim-facing wrapper captures the basic reusable consequences on the
`kolmogorov-probability-axioms` page: the empty set has measure zero, the
sample space has total mass one, and probability is monotone under inclusion.
The empty-set and monotonicity facts come from the measure structure; total mass one comes
from `IsProbabilityMeasure`.

Finite additivity for disjoint events in a probability space.

This is the exact existing-measure consequence used on the page. It does not
construct a probability measure from a raw finitely additive set function.

Countable additivity for pairwise disjoint measurable events.

This wraps the countable-additivity theorem carried by mathlib's `Measure`
structure. The reverse construction from raw axioms is a separate theorem.

Complement rule for probability measures.

The statement is scoped to measurable events. The finite-measure side
condition required by mathlib is automatic for probability measures.

Finite union bound for probability measures.

This is the finite-family version used in later learning-theory arguments:
the probability of a finite union is at most the sum of the event
probabilities. It does not require disjointness.

Countable union bound for probability measures.

This is the countable subadditivity form used by Borel-Cantelli and
probability tail-event arguments. It does not require the events to be
disjoint.

Continuity from below for probability measures.

This claim-facing wrapper captures the exact monotone sequence scope: if
events increase, their probabilities tend to the probability of the countable
union.

Continuity from above for probability measures.

The measure-theoretic theorem requires the sets to be null-measurable and one
set to have finite measure. Event measurability supplies null measurability;
the probability-measure instance supplies finite measure.
