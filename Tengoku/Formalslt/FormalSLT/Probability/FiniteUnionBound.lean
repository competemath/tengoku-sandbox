Finite union-bound seed.

This file proves the finite cardinality skeleton behind the probabilistic
union bound: the size of a finite union is bounded by the sum of the sizes of
the sets being unioned. It also proves the finite weighted probability
specialization: the mass of a finite union is bounded by the sum of the event
masses. It is intentionally not a countable Borel-Cantelli proof.

Finite cardinality union bound.

Scope note: this proves a finite-set counting inequality. It is a formal
ingredient for later probability-space work, not the full Borel-Cantelli
lemma on the topic page.

Finite weighted probability union bound.

Scope note: this proves a finite-support event-mass inequality under
nonnegative weights. It is closer to a probability union bound than the
cardinality skeleton, but it is still not a countable probability-space
Borel-Cantelli theorem.

Proof of the finite weighted probability union-bound seed.

The proof is pointwise: every outcome's union indicator is bounded by the sum
of its finite event indicators, then summed against nonnegative weights.

Finite weighted union bound in plain summation form.

The covered set `U` is described only by the property that each of its elements
lies in at least one `t j`.  Stating the hypothesis that way keeps the lemma
independent of how `U` was built, so a caller whose union set carries its own
`DecidableEq` instance never has to reconcile that instance with a freshly
elaborated `Finset.biUnion`.

Finite measure union bound with a supplied per-event budget sequence.

This is the finite budget-allocation form: if event `i` has mass at most
`budget i`, and the finite budget sum is bounded by `α`, then the union has
mass at most `α`.

Finite measure union bound with an equal split of a total budget.

The hypotheses keep the arithmetic explicit: `inv_card` is a chosen reciprocal
for the finite index count and `hbudget` records that the count times the
per-event budget is bounded by the desired total budget.
