# Conditional Markov inequality for nonnegative integrable RVs

A conditional analogue of Markov's inequality: for nonnegative integrable
`Y` and `c > 0`, the conditional probability `μ[1_{Y ≥ c} | m]` is
bounded above by `μ[Y | m] / c` almost surely. Stated additively as

    c · μ[1_{Y ≥ c} | m] ≤ᵐ[μ] μ[Y | m]

to avoid premature division by `c`.

This is the building block used to convert a conditional MGF bound into a
conditional tail bound (Cramér–Chernoff step), so it sits in the chain
between the extractor and the Freedman corollary.

**Mathlib status:** mathlib has unconditional Markov
(`MeasureTheory.mul_meas_ge_le_lintegral₀` and friends) but no direct
conditional analogue at `condExp` level. The proof here is a one-step
lift via `condExp_mono` of the pointwise inequality
`c · 1_{Y ≥ c}(ω) ≤ Y(ω)` (using `Y ≥ 0` a.s.), followed by
`condExp_smul` to factor `c` outside.

**Conditional Markov inequality (a.e. form).**

For nonnegative integrable `Y` and `c > 0`, the conditional probability
that `Y ≥ c`, multiplied by `c`, is bounded a.e. by `μ[Y | m]`.

The conditional probability is encoded as
`μ[1_{Y ≥ c} | m]` — the conditional expectation of the indicator. (This
is *not* the pointwise indicator: the inequality is at the conditional
level, not the realisation level.)
