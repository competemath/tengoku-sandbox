# Conditional Jensen inequality (specialization to ℝ-valued bounded RVs)

**Mathlib status:** the general conditional Jensen for convex
lower-semicontinuous functions on a Banach space already lives in
`Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Function.ConditionalExpectation.CondJensen` as
`ConvexOn.map_condExp_le_univ` (Yongxi Lin, Thomas Zhu 2026).

We do **not** reprove it. This module pins down the exact ℝ-valued
specialization the extractor needs (`φ ∘ X` integrable when `|X| ≤ b`
and `φ` is continuous on `[-b, b]`), so the downstream proof has a
single named lemma to invoke rather than threading the universal form.

If the specialization turns out to be a one-line corollary, this module
should be inlined into `Extractor.lean` rather than kept as a separate
file.

**Conditional Jensen for an ℝ-valued, bounded random variable and a
convex `φ` continuous on the image.**

The convex function `φ` need only be `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ φ` and
lower-semicontinuous for the mathlib lemma; we state the specialization
the extractor needs (one-dimensional case, real values).
