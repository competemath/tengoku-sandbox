# Conditional expectation of a product with a bounded `m`-measurable factor

**Pull-out property.** If `Z` is `m`-strongly-measurable and bounded,
and `Y` is integrable, then

    μ[Z · Y | m] =ᵐ[μ] Z · μ[Y | m].

This packages the specific form used by the extractor, including the
integrability bookkeeping for a bounded left factor.

**Pull-out: bounded `m`-measurable factor.**

For `Z` strongly `m`-measurable and (almost surely) bounded, and `Y`
integrable, the conditional expectation pulls the bounded factor out.
