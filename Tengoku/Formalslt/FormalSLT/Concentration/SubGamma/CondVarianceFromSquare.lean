# Conditional variance from conditional `E[X²]`

When `X` is conditionally centered (`μ[X | m] = 0`), the conditional
variance reduces to the conditional second moment:

    Var(X | m) = μ[X² | m] − (μ[X | m])²  = μ[X² | m]  a.s.

This is the bridge between the bound `μ[X² | m] ≤ σ²` provided to the
extractor and the textbook sub-gamma bound which is usually stated in
terms of conditional variance.

This file records the centered identity in the form used by the
conditional sub-gamma extractor.

**Centered conditional second moment dominates square of conditional
mean (trivially equal under centering).**

When `μ[X | m] =ᵐ[μ] 0`, the conditional second moment `μ[X² | m]`
*is* the conditional variance, and the sub-gamma bound's `σ²` hypothesis
bounds it directly.

Stated as the explicit identity so downstream proofs can rewrite freely.
