# Prior-mixture betting masters over an uncountable strategy class

`ComputablePredictableBettingMixture` aggregates a *finite* catalog of legal
predictable betting strategies: the master bet is the wealth-weighted average
of the catalog bets, its wealth equals the finite prior mixture, and it pays
`- log (weight j)` against any single catalog member.

This module replaces the finite prior sum by an integral against a prior
measure `strategyPrior` on an arbitrary index type `Kappa`, so the competing
class may be uncountable.  Three facts carry over verbatim with `Finset.sum`
replaced by `∫ ... ∂strategyPrior`, under explicit integrability obligations:
the one-step mixture recursion, the aggregation identity (the master's own
betting wealth equals the prior mixture of the component wealths), and the
interval legality of the master bet.

The reason the generalization is not cosmetic is the *price*.  Under a
nonatomic prior, every singleton strategy has mass zero, so
`aggregate_logWealth_regret_le`, which charges `- log (weight j)` for one
atom, has no non-vacuous singleton instance.  The replacement charged here is
the log prior mass of a measurable *set* of strategies,
`- log (strategyPrior.real B)`, against the worst component wealth on that
set.  Specializing `B` to a single atom of a finite uniform catalog recovers
`log (card)`; specializing it to a prior ball is what a covering or
modulus-of-continuity argument would consume.

Three things this module does not do.  The mixture is an integral, so unlike
the finite and dyadic masters it is not an exact rational computation; no
executability claim is made.  The e-process property is not re-proved here:
`continuumMasterWealth_eq_bettingWealthProcess` transports it from whatever
mixture-supermartingale argument supplies it for the prior integral.  And the
conclusion is a statement about realized wealth along the observed path; it is
not a statement about future, stationary, population, or deployment risk, and
no score-to-risk bridge is asserted.
