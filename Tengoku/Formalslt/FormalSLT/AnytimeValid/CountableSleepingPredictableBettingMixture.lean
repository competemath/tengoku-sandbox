# Exact countable sleeping-expert betting mixtures

This module extends the computable finite betting master to a countable
catalog without evaluating an infinite sum. Expert `j` sleeps through times
`k < j`, and the prior weight of expert `j` is `2⁻⁽ʲ⁺¹⁾`. At time `n`, all
experts `j ≥ n` still have wealth one, so their entire infinite tail has the
closed form `2⁻ⁿ`. The countable mixture wealth and its current master bet are
therefore finite computations.

The resulting master automatically competes with every expert once that
expert has entered the active prefix. This is a countable, growing, exact
strategy mixture. It is not a parameter-free continuum coin-betting theorem.
