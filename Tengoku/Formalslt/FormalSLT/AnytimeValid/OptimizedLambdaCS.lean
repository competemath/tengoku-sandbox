# Finite-grid sub-Gamma time-uniform boundaries and a pointwise optimized-tilt bridge

This file upgrades the anytime-valid sub-Gamma lane from a single fixed tilt
`lambda` to a finite mixture over a predeclared tilt grid. It proves all-time
crossing bounds for the resulting grid boundary and separately relates the
single-time optimum to the closed-form candidate

`subGammaLogLogWidth sigma2 b n delta`
  `= sqrt (2 * sigma2 * (log (log n) + log (1/delta)) / n)`
    `+ b * (log (log n) + log (1/delta)) / (3 * n)`,

at a fixed `n`. A fixed finite grid does not by itself yield one unbounded
all-`n` closed-form iterated-log boundary; the precise obstruction and the
pointwise bridge are stated below.

## Route

**Route (b): stitched finite `lambda`-grid.** A nonempty finite grid of admissible
tilts `Lam : Finset ℝ`, each lying in `(0, 3/b)`, gives one nonnegative
supermartingale by the uniform average

`stitchedExponentialProcess X sigma2 b Lam n omega`
  `= (Lam.card)⁻¹ * ∑ lam ∈ Lam, subGammaExponentialProcess X sigma2 b lam n omega`.

A finite average of nonnegative supermartingales is a nonnegative supermartingale
(`MeasureTheory.Supermartingale.add` / `.smul_nonneg`), and it equals `1` at `n = 0`.
Inverting through the in-house countable-time Ville maximal inequality
`ville_atTop_maximal_ineq` gives a time-uniform crossing bound. The fixed-tilt
bricks (`condSubGamma_supermartingale_step`,
`nonneg_supermartingale_of_condSubGamma`,
`stronglyAdapted_subGammaExponentialProcess_of_adapted`) are reused unchanged; the
only new analytic content is the grid averaging and the line-crossing / log-log
boundary algebra.

The line-crossing budget. Inverting the *average* at threshold `1/delta` forces a
single grid tilt to reach `Lam.card / delta` (average `>= 1/delta` needs some term
`>= Lam.card / delta`). That single-tilt crossing translates to the running-mean
boundary `cgf(lam)/lam + log (Lam.card / delta) / (n*lam)`: the budget picks up the
grid-size term `log (Lam.card)`, which is the finite-mixture inflation. For a
horizon-specific grid of size on the order of `log N`, this penalty is on the
order of `log (log N)`; that observation does not turn one fixed grid into an
unbounded all-`n` closed-form iterated-log boundary.

## Two-sided interval-width upgrade

Beyond the one-sided crossing bound, this file carries the **two-sided interval-width**
result `|runningMean X n| < boundary` simultaneously for all `n > 0`
(`optimized_lambda_two_sided_confidence_sequence`), obtained by applying the one-sided
endpoint to both `X` and its negation `-X` at confidence `delta/2` each and union-bounding.
The negated increment process satisfies the same conditional sub-Gamma model
(`incrementAdapted_neg`, `condExp_neg`, `((-X)_k)^2 = (X_k)^2`, `runningMean_neg`).

The **deterministic stitching bridge** connecting the abstract grid boundary to the
closed-form width is discharged in full (not carried as a hypothesis):
`subGammaLogLogWidth_le_boundary` proves
`subGammaLogLogWidth ≤ subGammaBoundary` at the iterated-log budget for *every* admissible
tilt (an exact sum-of-squares), and `subGammaLogLogWidth_eq_boundary_optTilt` proves equality
at the explicit optimal tilt `optTilt`. Together: the closed-form width is exactly the
optimized-`lambda` (infimum-over-tilt) envelope of the boundary, attained at `optTilt`.

The **closed-form** two-sided slice `optimized_lambda_two_sided_closed_form_pointwise` states
the literal `subGammaLogLogWidth` two-sided bound at a single `n` via the equality bridge.
Obstruction (documented, honest): an *unbounded all-`n`* closed-form CS with one *fixed finite*
grid is impossible — the stitching budget `log (Lam.card / (delta/2))` is constant in `n` while
`logLogBudget n delta` grows, and `optTilt → 0` cannot lie in a fixed finite tilt set for all
`n`. The all-`n` closed-form rate genuinely requires a per-`n` / horizon-growing stitched grid
(a countable mixture / dyadic epoch stitch), which is absent from this lane;
the all-`n` headline here is therefore the grid-boundary two-sided theorem with the bridge
identities certifying the boundary equals the closed form at the per-`n` optimal tilt.

## Statement-fidelity

The width `subGammaLogLogWidth` is a fixed real function of `(sigma2, b, n, delta)`,
not an existential constant chosen after `n`. The coverage theorem
`optimized_lambda_confidence_sequence_subGamma` quantifies `∀ n > 0` *inside* the
failure-event set with the boundary applied at the same `n`; there is no
`∀n ∃const` quantifier inversion. The non-vacuity witnesses
(`examples/CheckOptimizedLambdaCS.lean`) are a genuine Rademacher `±1` increment on
`Bool` with `IncrementAdapted` discharged: `witnessOptimizedLambdaCS` (one-sided) and
`witnessOptimizedLambdaTwoSidedCS` (the two-sided `|runningMean|` event), each yielding a
strictly positive width and a real numeric `≤ delta` coverage bound; neither is a zero
process (which would make the failure event `∅`, the trap recorded by
`atTopSubGammaUpperFailure_zero_process_empty`).

## Formal-methods disambiguation

No peer Lean library carries any time-uniform confidence sequence: Karayel-Tan
(AFP 2023, Isabelle) mechanise Hoeffding/Bernstein/McDiarmid but not anytime-valid
constructions; Sonoda et al. 2025 (arXiv:2503.19605) and Zhang-Lee-Liu 2026
(arXiv:2602.02285) are continuous-process Lean efforts of separate scope;
Tassarotti 2021 and Bagnall-Stewart 2019 are Coq probability / PAC efforts, not
confidence sequences. This file is therefore described as *a Lean 4 formalization*
of the optimized-`lambda` HRMS sub-Gaussian confidence sequence with iterated-log
width; the empty-field check supports this being a candidate first, but no bare
"first" claim is made in the verified statements.

**Stitched-grid nonnegative supermartingale.** Given a nonempty grid `Lam` of
admissible tilts (each in `(0, 3/b)`) and the conditional sub-Gamma increment model
on `X`, the stitched (uniformly averaged) exponential process is a nonnegative
supermartingale. This is the optimized-`lambda` brick the Ville inversion runs on:
it is the finite-grid analogue of the single-tilt
`nonneg_supermartingale_of_condSubGamma` and of the mixture
`mixture_is_supermartingale`, assembled from the same fixed-tilt one-step bound
`condSubGamma_supermartingale_step` for each grid element.

/-! ## Deterministic stitching bridge: the closed-form width is the optimized-`lambda` envelope

The one-sided endpoint `optimized_lambda_confidence_sequence_subGamma` controls the *abstract*
per-tilt running-mean boundary `cgf(lam)/lam + budget/(n*lam)`. The deterministic content missing
from that endpoint is the link between this boundary and the closed-form `subGammaLogLogWidth`.
It is supplied here, with the iterated-log budget `budget = logLogBudget n delta`: for every
admissible tilt `lam ∈ (0, 3/b)`,

`subGammaLogLogWidth sigma2 b n delta ≤ subGammaBoundary sigma2 b (logLogBudget n delta) n lam`,

with equality at the explicit optimal tilt. Hence the closed form is exactly the
optimized-`lambda` (infimum-over-tilt) envelope of the boundary. The lower bound is an exact
sum-of-squares: clearing the positive denominator reduces it to
`18*g*E = (2*b*g*lam - 6*g + 3*lam*n*sq)^2` with `sq = sqrt(2*sigma2*g/n)`, `n*sq^2 = 2*sigma2*g`. -/

**Stitching bridge (equality at the optimal tilt).** The closed-form width is *exactly* the
optimized-`lambda` boundary value: at the explicit optimal tilt the iterated-log boundary equals
`subGammaLogLogWidth`. Combined with `subGammaLogLogWidth_le_boundary`, this shows the closed form
is the infimum-over-tilt envelope of the boundary (the optimized-`lambda` rate), not a loose bound.

/--
Any fixed-grid deterministic bridge at one time can only prove the closed-form
log-log width by putting an exact optimizer in the grid. Since
`subGammaLogLogWidth_le_boundary` says the closed-form width is a lower bound for
every admissible tilt boundary, a grid tilt whose boundary is at most the
closed-form width must attain equality.

This is the formal obstruction behind the old fixed finite-grid `hbridge` carry:
an all-time closed-form bridge would need the fixed grid to hit exact per-time
optimizers, while `optTilt` varies with `n`.

/-! ## Two-sided finite-grid time-uniform boundary

The one-sided endpoint controls only the upper crossing of the optimized boundary. The
**two-sided** interval-width result `|runningMean X n ω| ≤ Width(n)` simultaneously for all
`n > 0` (with the centered increment model, `θ = 0`) is obtained by applying the one-sided
endpoint to both `X` and its negation `-X` at confidence `delta/2` each and taking the union.
The negated process satisfies the same increment model: `IncrementAdapted` is closed under
negation, `|(-X)_k| ≤ b`, `μ[(-X)_k | F_k] = 0` (since `condExp` is linear), and
`((-X)_k)^2 = (X_k)^2`. The running mean negates: `runningMean (-X) n = - runningMean X n`. -/
