# Test supermartingales, e-values, and safe-testing Type-I control

This file packages the safe-testing / anytime-valid testing layer on top of the
banked nonnegative-supermartingale Ville maximal inequality
`FormalSLT.AnytimeValid.ville_maximal_ineq`. This module formalizes the
nonnegative-supermartingale subclass of e-processes: a process
`E : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` that is (i) nonnegative, (ii) normalized at the origin
(`E 0 = 1`), and (iii) a `𝒢`-supermartingale under `μ`.
Its running prefix maximum is the realized "betting wealth"; rejecting the null
when that wealth reaches `1/α` controls the Type-I error at level `α`, uniformly
over the stopping rule. This is the testing-side counterpart of the
confidence-sequence layer in `SubGaussianCS.lean` / `MixtureCS.lean`.

Three named results package the maximal-inequality, structural-product, and
optional-stopping interfaces (no new hard analysis):

* `eProcess_typeI_control`: the safe-testing guarantee. For an `EProcess μ 𝒢 E`
  under a probability measure, level `0 < α`, and horizon `n`, the rejection
  event "the realized prefix max of `E` reaches `1/α`" has `μ`-measure at most
  `α`: `μ.real {ω | 1/α ≤ finiteRunningMax E n ω} ≤ α`. This is the literal
  anytime-valid Type-I statement up to `n` (the running-max event, i.e. rejecting
  at *any* time `≤ n`), not a single fixed-time event. Instantiate
  `ville_maximal_ineq` at `a = 1/α`, divide through, and collapse `∫ E 0 = 1`.

* `eProcess_product_of_supermartingale`: a product constructor under an explicit
  product-supermartingale premise. The
  pointwise product of two e-processes is again an e-process provided the product
  is again a `𝒢`-supermartingale. The module does not formalize an independence
  condition implying that premise. It packages the remaining obligations:
  nonnegativity and the start at `1` (`1 * 1 = 1`).

* `eProcess_optionalContinuation`: optional continuation / stopped e-value. For
  any `ℕ∞`-valued `𝒢`-stopping time `τ` bounded by `n`, the stopped value
  `stoppedValue E τ` integrates to at most `1`: `∫ ω, stoppedValue E τ ω ∂μ ≤ 1`.
  This is the `E[E_τ] ≤ 1` form of the e-value guarantee under optional stopping;
  it follows from `Submartingale.expected_stoppedValue_mono` applied to `-E`
  (`E[E_τ] ≤ E[E_0] = 1`), the same route the keystone uses.

A nonconstant witness (the fixed-tilt exponential of a Rademacher increment, a
nonnegative supermartingale with `E 0 = 1` and `E_1 > 1` on a positive-mass
event) is built in `examples/CheckEProcess.lean`. The checker instantiates the
three theorems and obtains the numeric Type-I bound `≤ 1/4` at threshold
`1/α = 4`; it does not claim that this higher threshold is crossed.

## Formal-methods scope

The module makes no novelty or priority claim. Its scope differs from nearby
formal developments as follows:
Karayel–Tan (AFP 2023) mechanise Hoeffding/Bernstein/McDiarmid concentration in
Isabelle/HOL (fixed-sample, no anytime-valid object, no e-process, no test
martingale). Sonoda et al. 2025 (arXiv:2503.19605) and Zhang–Lee–Liu 2026
(arXiv:2602.02285) are continuous-process Lean efforts of separate scope, neither
an e-value / safe-testing Type-I guarantee nor an e-process rejection rule.
Tassarotti (2021) is a probabilistic-program / Coq verification line, not
anytime-valid testing. Bagnall–Stewart (2019) is a Coq PAC-learning /
generalization-bound line (fixed-sample, no e-process). These bounded
comparisons are not an ecosystem-wide absence result.

filtration `𝒢`: a process
`E : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` that is nonnegative, normalized to `1` at the origin, and a
`𝒢`-supermartingale under `μ`. These are exactly the three structural fields and
nothing that smuggles the Type-I conclusion. The `E 0 = 1` normalization is the
deterministic-start case (`∀ ω, E 0 ω = 1`), so `∫ E 0 = 1` under a probability
measure. -/

**Product constructor (supermartingale form).** The pointwise product of two
e-processes is again an e-process provided the product is again a
`𝒢`-supermartingale (`hprod_sup`). This is the honest, dischargeable hypothesis:
the module does not formalize a conditional-independence criterion that would
imply it. The statement records exactly the property used, while nonnegativity
and the `1 * 1 = 1` start are discharged from the two factor e-processes. -/
