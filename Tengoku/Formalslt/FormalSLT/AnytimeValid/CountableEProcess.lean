# Countable mixtures of e-processes

This module packages the countable supermartingale interchange theorem from
`DyadicEpochCS` as a reusable closure rule for e-processes.  The weights and
component processes are fixed before observing the path.  The theorem is
countable in the catalog index and countable in time; it does not permit a
data-dependent change of the mixing weights.

The explicit adaptedness, integrability, and set-integral summability package
is the exact analytic interface needed by
`countableWeightedSupermartingale_tsum`.  Concrete bounded-process modules can
discharge this package once and then reuse the closure theorem.

/--
A normalized countable mixture of e-processes is an e-process, provided the
countable series satisfies the adaptedness, integrability, and set-integral
summability conditions needed to interchange its sum with conditional
expectations.

Strict positivity of the weights is not required for closure.  It is required
only by downstream selected-atom bounds that divide by the selected weight.
