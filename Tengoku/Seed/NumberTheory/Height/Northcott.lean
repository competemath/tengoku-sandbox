# Results on the Northcott property for heights

Assume that `K` is a field with a family of admissible absolute values that satisfies
the Northcott property for `mulHeight₁`.
We provide instances showing that `K` also satisfies the Northcott property
* for `logHeight₁`,
* (TODO) for `Projectivization.mulHeight`,
* (TODO) for `Projectivization.logHeight`.

## TODO

Add instances for heights on projectivizations.
