# Distance between indexed suprema

This file contains an order-theoretic Lipschitz estimate for real-valued
indexed suprema.  It is independent of the statistical-learning definitions.
-/

open Set

/--
Reindexing an indexed supremum along a surjection does not change it.

Unlike `Function.Surjective.iSup_comp` for complete lattices, this version is
available for conditionally complete lattices because it compares the two
ranges directly.

If two bounded-above real families are pointwise at distance at most `c`,
then their indexed suprema are at distance at most `c`.
