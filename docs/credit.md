# How credit and verification work

- **Verification is automatic.** The repository checks every submission: it must compile
  cleanly and not be a longer route to something the tree already reaches. A
  maintainer then approves the merge, and promotion to `trusted` builds the
  record again from scratch.
- **Credit is permanent, and shared.** Put a docstring above your theorem naming
  the human author, any AI used, and a link to you (GitHub, LinkedIn, ORCID, or
  your [CompeteMath ID](https://competemath.com/whoami)). It stays in the tree.

  ```lean
  /-- The sum of the first `n` odd numbers is `n ^ 2`.

  Author: Ada Lovelace (https://github.com/ada), with Claude Fable 5.1. -/
  theorem sum_range_odd (n : ℕ) : ∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, (2 * i + 1) = n ^ 2 := by
    ...
  ```

  One sentence on what it says, then one line starting with `Author:`. That word
  is what the checks key on: no pull request can remove or edit the line once it
  is in.
- **Submitting a whole project?** Point the
  [bulk attribution tool](../tools/attribute/README.md) at the directory with your
  credit string once; it writes the docstrings for you.
- **Tiers.** Submissions start in `tentative` or `staging` and are promoted to
  `trusted` only once the relevant library checks have compiled them from scratch.
